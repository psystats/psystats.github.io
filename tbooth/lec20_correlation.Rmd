## Today
- Introduce Pearson correlation
  - Build from variance...
  - ...to covariance...
  - ...to correlation.
  
## Learning objectives
- Understand the basic features of correlation coefficients.
- Understand the relation between covariance and correlation.
- Understand how to calculate Pearson correlation.
- Know how to use R to calculate correlations.

## Purpose
- Correlations measure the degree of association between two variables.
	- If one goes up does the other go up (positive association)?
	- If one variable changes (varies) does the other change (vary) too.
	- If one goes up does the other go down (negative association)?
- The value ranges from -1 to 1.
  - Values close to |1| indicate stronger associations.
	- Values close to 0 indicate no association.

## Data Requirements
- There is a tight of correlation for almost all data types.

| X           | Y           | Correlation Type |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Continuous  | Continuous  | Pearson          |
| Continuous  | Categorical | Polyserial       |
| Continuous  | Binary      | Biserial         |
| Categorical | Categorical | Polychoric       |
| Binary      | Binary      | Tetrachoric      |
| Rank        | Rank        | Spearman         |
| Nominal     | Nominal     | Chi-square       |


## Scatterplots
- Typical visualization of correlations is through scatterplots.
- Scatterplots plot points at the (x,y) co-ordinates for two measured variables.
- We plot these points for each individual in our data set.
	- This produces the clouds of points.

## Simple Data
```{r}
data <- tibble(
  name = as_factor(c("John", "Peter","Robert","David","George","Matthew", "Bradley")),
  height = c(1.52,1.60,1.68,1.78,1.86,1.94,2.09),
  weight = c(54,49,50,67,70,110,98)
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(data)
```

## Scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
John <- ggplot(data[1,], aes(height, weight)) + 
  xlim(1.50, 2.15) +
  ylim(45, 115) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), nudge_x = 0.025) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = height, y = weight, xend = height, yend = 45), 
               arrow=arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(0.25, "cm"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = height, y = weight, xend = 1.5, yend = weight), 
               arrow=arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(0.25, "cm")))
John
```


## Scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(height, weight)) + 
  xlim(1.50, 2.15) +
  ylim(45, 115) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), nudge_x = 0.035)
```

## Strength of correlation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cor <- c(0.90, 0.50, 0.20, 0.00, -0.20, -0.50, -0.90)
plot_list <- list()

for(i in 1:7) {
  dat <- mvrnorm(500, mu = c(0,0), Sigma = matrix(c(1, cor[i], cor[i], 1),nrow=2), empirical = T)
  dat <- data.frame(dat)
  colnames(dat) <- c("Variable1", "Variable2")
  
  out <- ggplot(dat, aes(Variable1, Variable2))+
    geom_point() +
    stat_ellipse(geom = "polygon", alpha = 0.25)
  plot_list[[i]] = out

}

(plot_list[[1]] + plot_list[[2]] + plot_list[[3]]) / (plot_list[[5]] + plot_list[[6]] + plot_list[[7]])

```

##  Variance 

$$
Var_x = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})}^2}{N-1}
$$

- Variance is the mean squared deviation from the mean.

## Variance

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mean_vec2 <- rep(mean(data$weight), 7)
x <- 1:7
data$Name <- factor(data$name, levels = data$name)
deviance2 <- round((data$weight - mean(data$weight)), 2)

weight_var <- ggplot(data, aes(name, weight))+
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(data$weight), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(x = x, y = data$weight , xend = x, yend = mean_vec2, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face="bold")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = deviance2), nudge_y = c(rep(-2, 5), rep(2, 2))) 

weight_var
```

## Variance

```{r,echo=FALSE}
mean_vec <- rep(mean(data$height), 7)
x <- 1:7
data$name <- factor(data$name, levels = data$name)
deviance <- round((data$height - mean(data$height)), 2)

height_var <- ggplot(data, aes(name, height))+
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(data$height), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(x = x, y = data$height , xend = x, yend = mean_vec, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face="bold")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = deviance), nudge_y = c(rep(-0.02, 4), rep(0.02, 3))) 
height_var
```

## Covariance
- So variance = deviation around the mean of a single variable.
- **Co**variance concerns variation in two variables.
- To think about the equation for covariance, suppose we re-write variance as follows. Instead of:

$$
Var_x = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})}^2}{N-1}
$$

- we use

$$
Cov_{xx} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})(x_i - \bar{x})}}{N-1}
$$

## Covariance

$$
Cov_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{N-1}
$$

- So our covariance is identical to our variance, with the exception that our summed termed is the combined deviance from the respective means of both $x$ and $y$.

## Covariance
- For our data:

```{r}
round(cov(data$height, data$weight),4)
```

## Scale & Covariance
- So what does a covariance of 4.1681 between height and weight mean?
	- I have no idea!
- Covariance is related to the scale of the variables we are analysing.
	- Makes sense right? variance was just the same.
- What about if we had measured height in centimetres not metres?

```{r}
round(cov(data$height*100, data$weight),2)
```

## Correlation
- How do we deal with problems of scale?
  - We standardize.
- And how do we standardize?
  - We divide by an estimate of the variability.
	- Here, the product of standard deviations of X and Y.
- The resulting statistic is the Pearson Product Moment Correlation ($r$)

## Correlation
$$
r = \frac{Cov_{xy}}{SD_xSD_y}
$$

- Or in full

$$
r = \frac{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{N-1}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})}^2}{N-1}} \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \bar{x})}^2}{N-1}}}
$$

## Correlation
- In our data:

```{r}
cov(data$height, data$weight)/ (sd(data$height)*sd(data$weight))
```

- or we can use built in functions:

```{r}
cor(data$height, data$weight)
```

## Correlation = ES
- For some other tests we have discussed associated measures of effect size.
- Remember, an effect size is a standardized measures of the type relationship of interest.
  - So Cohen's D is a standardize raw mean difference.
- Well our correlation **is** standardized
  - It is a standardized covariance.
  - Or a standardize measure of association
  
## Hypotheses
- For many people, correlations are descriptive statistics.
- As such, they do not require significance tests.
- But in other circumstances a correlation may be a test of interest, and we can formulate associated hypothesis tests.

## Hypotheses
- The association between two random variables = 0.
- As such, the null for a correlation is:

$$
H_0: r = 0
$$
- And the two-tailed alternative:

$$
H_1: r \neq 0
$$

- The sampling distribution of $r$ is approximately normal with large N, and is $t$ distributed when N is small.
	- Thus we assess the significance using the $t$-distribution with N-2 degrees of freedom.

##  Hypothesis testing & significance 
- The $t$-statistic for a given correlation is calculated as:

$$
t = r \sqrt \frac{N-2}{1 - r^2}
$$

- So for our data:

$$
t = r \sqrt \frac{N-2}{1 - r^2} = 0.87 \sqrt \frac{5}{1 - 0.87^2} = 0.87\sqrt \frac{5}{0.2431} = 0.87*4.535 = 3.95
$$

## Is our test significant?
- So the $t$ associated with our correlation is 3.95
	- Our degrees of freedom are N-2 = 7-2 = 5
	- We will use two-tailed $\alpha = .05$

## Is our test significant?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(NULL, aes(x = c(-6,6))) +
  stat_function(fun=dt,
                geom = "line",
                args = list(df=5)) +
  stat_function(fun = dt, 
                geom = "area",
                xlim = c(qt(0.975,5), 6),
                alpha=.25,
                fill = "blue",
                args = list(df=4)) +
    stat_function(fun = dt, 
                geom = "area",
                xlim = c(qt(0.025,5), -6),
                alpha=.25,
                fill = "blue",
                args = list(df=5)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.95, col="red") +
  xlab("\n t") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("t-distribution (df=5); t-statistic (3.95; red line)")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  LowerCrit = round(qt(0.025, 5),2),
  UpperCrit = round(qt(0.975, 5),2),
)
```

## In R
```{r}
cor.test(data$height, data$weight)
```

##  Write up 
- Write up is very simple for small number of variables.
- There was a strong positive correlation between height and weight ($r$(5) = .87, $p$<.05) in the current sample. As height increased, so did weight.
- Often we report lots of correlations and do so in a correlation matrix.

## Correlation matrices
- Values in diagonal are correlations with itself.
	- Always 1.00
	- Not informative
	- Can omit or replace with e.g. reliability
- Symmetric.
	- Above and below diagonal = same values.
	- Do not need both.
	- Could switch with p-values or leave empty

## Correlation matrices
```{r}
pers_items <- bfi[,c(1:5)]
pers_cors <- hetcor(pers_items)
```

```{r}
pers_cors$correlations
```

## Assumptions
- Variables must be interval or ratio (continuous)
	- No test: about design.
- Variables must be normally distributed.
	- Histograms, skew, QQ-Plots, Shapiro-Wilks.
- Homoscedasticity
- The relationship between the two variables must be linear.
	- Visualize: scatterplots.

```{r}
round(cor(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1),2)
round(cor(anscombe$x2, anscombe$y2),2)
round(cor(anscombe$x3, anscombe$y3),2)
round(cor(anscombe$x4, anscombe$y4),2)
```

## Anscombe Quartet

```{r, echo=FALSE}
a <- ggplot(anscombe, aes(x=x1, y=y1)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlab("X1") +
  ylab("Y1")

b <- ggplot(anscombe, aes(x=x2, y=y2)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlab("X2") +
  ylab("Y2")

c <- ggplot(anscombe, aes(x=x3, y=y3)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlab("X3") +
  ylab("Y3")

d <- ggplot(anscombe, aes(x=x4, y=y4)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlab("X4") +
  ylab("Y4")

(a +b) / (c + d)
```


## Correlation and causation
- You will talk more about this point in lab
  - And forever more when discussing statistical results.
- Typically we hope to be able to explain *why* things happen.
- Though correlation is a fundamental metric in statistics, it actually does not help us (on its own) with this.
- An association between two things does not mean it **causes** the other.
- Much more on this to come in lab and next year.

## Tasks for this week...
- Keep safe and healthy.
