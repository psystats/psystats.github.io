## Today
- Why do we need probability?
- Some concepts about sets
- Assigning probability - basic rules

## Learning objectives
- Understand the link between probability, models and data
- Understand the basic rules of probability
- (From lab) being able to apply these rules

## Why probability?
- Consider the statements:
  - There is a 50\50 chance of a fair coin landing on Heads
  - There is a $\frac{13}{52}$ chance of drawing a heart in a deck of cards
- In both cases, we are presenting something based on known information about the world.
  - *We have a model for the world*.
- But we do not have data.
  - We do not have some results from tossing a coin.

## Why probability?
- In statistics and data analysis, the opposite is true.
- We have some data, but we do not know the *truth of the world*
  - We have to make inferences about it.
- In order to make these inferences, we are going to use probability, and models of the world based on it.
- But before we do, we need to build up some concepts.

## Sets
- Probabilty is built on the theory of sets.
- **Set**: Well-defined collection of objects
- Sets are composed of **elements** or **members**
  - E.g. students in class
  - E.g. real numbers between 0 and 1

## Set notation
- $d \in D$
  - d is an element of D
- $e \notin D$
  - e is not an element of D
- F = {f $\mid$ f in an integer, $1 \leq f \leq 10$}
  - F includes elements **such that** f is an integer greater tan or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10.


## Sets
- **Universal Set**: A set of all elements we are concerned with.
- **Subset**: A Set B is a subset of A if and only if every $x \in B$, then $x \in A$
  - $B \subseteq A$, B is a subset of A
- **Proper subset**: a Set B is a proper subset of A if B is a subset of A and at least one member of A is NOT a member of B
  - $B \subset A$, B is a proper subset of A

## Sets: and or

## Sets: Empty, complement, difference

- Key point on empty sets: P and R here are **mutually exclusive**
- If P occurs, R **cannot** occur.

## Does some of it seem familiar?
- Working with sets is often referred to as Boolean algebra
- You have some across this when you work with logicals in R.


## Sets & Probability
- In probability we talk about a *sample space*
  - Sample space (S) = all possible outcomes.
  - Every point in this sample space is a single outcome.
- An event (A)is a set of outcomes from S
- A *simple event* (a) = single point such that $a \in S$
- *Random experiment* = sampling of simple events from a sample space.

## Defining probability
- **Long run frequency:** Frequentist statistics.
- **Degree of belief:** Bayesian statistics.
- We will be working with (1), but it is important to know there are different schools of thought as these relate to how we use statistics in practice and make inferences.

## Defining probability
- **Analytic definition of probability:**
  - If there are $a$ ways in which $x$ can occur and $b$ ways in which $x$ can fail to occur, then $P(x) = a/(a+b)$
    - If a bag contains 85 light and 15 dark caramels and you reach into the bag randomly and grab a caramel, P(light) = 85/(85+15) = .85 (or 85%)

## Defining probability
- $P(x)$, or probability of x, is the proportion of times you would observe $x$ if you took an infinite number of samples.
  - If I roll a die an infinite number of times, the probability I would roll a 1 would be exactly 1/6.
- The long run, or the *law of large numbers*
  - Given an event $A$ and a probability $P(A)$, over N trials, the probability that the relative frequency of $Aâ€™$ will differ from $P(A)$ approaches 0 as N approaches infinity

## Coin toss

``` {r echo=FALSE }
par(
  mfrow=c(2,3),
  mar=c(2, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))
set.seed(101)
plot(as.factor(rbinom(6, 1, .50)), main="N=6")
box(bty="L")
set.seed(103)
plot(as.factor(rbinom(10, 1, .50)), main="N=10")
box(bty="L")
set.seed(104)
plot(as.factor(rbinom(20, 1, .50)), main="N=20")
box(bty="L")
set.seed(105)
plot(as.factor(rbinom(100, 1, .50)), main="N=100")
box(bty="L")
set.seed(106)
plot(as.factor(rbinom(1000, 1, .50)), main="N=1000")
box(bty="L")
set.seed(107)
plot(as.factor(rbinom(10000, 1, .50)), main="N=10000")
box(bty="L")

par(
  mfrow=c(1,1), 
  mar=c(5.1,4.1,4.1,2.1))
```

## Example
- Suppose we have the following experiment.
  - We roll two die.
  - The outcome is the sum of the numbers on the upward pointing space.
  
## Example: Sample Space

|   | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4**  | **5**  | **6**  |
|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| **1** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
| **2** | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| **3** | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  | 8  | 9  |
| **4** | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| **5** | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 |
| **6** | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

## Example: Probabilities

| **Simple Event** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| **Frequency**    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3  | 2  | 1  |
| **Probability**  | $\frac{1}{36}$ |  $\frac{2}{36}$ |  $\frac{3}{36}$ | $\frac{4}{36}$  |  $\frac{5}{36}$ | $\frac{6}{36}$  |  $\frac{5}{36}$ |  $\frac{4}{36}$ |  $\frac{3}{36}$  |   $\frac{2}{36}$ |  $\frac{1}{36}$  |


## Example: Probability Distribution

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  X = factor(c(2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,11,11,12))
) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=X)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) +
  ylab("Probability \n") 
```


## Rules of Probability
- $P(i)$ = probability of event $i$
- $0 \leq P(i) \leq 1$ = probability of event $i$ is between 0 and 1
- $P(i_1) + P(i_2) + ... + P(i_n) = P(S)$ = probability of all events in sample space $S$ = 1
- $P(i) + P(\sim i) = 1$, so $P( \sim i) = 1 - P(i)$

## Joint Probability
- Probability of A **and** B = $p(A \bigcap B)$
    - Joint event or *intersection* of A and B
- Probability of A **or** B = $p(A \bigcup B)$
    - *Union* of A and B
- Probability of **not** A = $p(\sim A)$
    - We describe the event not A as the *complement* of A.

## Relations between events
- **Mutually exclusive** events: If A occurs, B can not occur.
- **Independent** events: The occurance of event A does not impact event B.
- **Dependent** events: The occurance of event A **does** impact event B.
    - By impact, I am referring to changes in the probability of the events.

## Probabilities of joint events
- For mutually exclusive events, the probability of the union of those events is the sum of the individual probabilities.
  - Think of the coin example:

$$p(Head \bigcup Tails) = p(Head) + p(Tails) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$$

## Probabilities of joint events
- For non-mutually exclusive events.

$$p(A \bigcup B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A \bigcap B)$$

- Why might this be so?

$$p(king or heart) = \frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} - \frac{1}{52} = \frac{4}{13} = 0.31$$
    
## Probabilities of joint events
- So far we have looked at rules for unions (or), but what about intersections (and) events:
- If events are independent, then;

$$p(A \bigcap B) = p(A)p(B)$$

- Consider getting a success (Head) in a coin flip (event A), and cutting the deck on a heart (event B).

$$p(A \bigcap B) = \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} = .125 = 12.5%$$

## Sampling: With and without replacement
- In the lab there were examples of the use of `sample()` with `replace=T` and `replace=F`
- What does this mean?
    - Imagine a bag of balls, 6 red 4 blue.
    - We take 1 ball
        - $p(red) = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$ = 0.60
        - $p(blue) = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}$ = 0.40

## Sampling: With and without replacement
- If we put the ball back, then the probabilities are the same next draw.
- If we keep the ball, then the probabilities change.
    - If we assume it was red, then;
        - $p(red) = \frac{5}{9}$ = 0.56
        - $p(blue) = \frac{4}{9}$ = 0.44

## Sampling: With and without replacement
- This matters with respect to thinking about multiple trials. 
- If we draw two balls from the sample, what is the probability they are both red?
- As long as the events are independent, then:
    - **With replacement** = 0.6*0.6 = 0.36 = 36%
    - **Without replacement** = 0.60*0.56 = 0.34 = 34%
