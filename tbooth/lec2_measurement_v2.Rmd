## Today
- Measurement in psychology
- Levels of measurement
- Types of variable
- Begin to build our class .Rmd

## Learning objectives
- Begin to build intuition about the interaction between measurement, data types and information.
- Know the four typical levels of measurement discussed in psychology
- Know broad classification of data types

## Asking questions
- When we ask research questions, we ask about phenomena.
	- But we cant answer these questions unless we measure the phenomena/construct
- Measurement is a huge philosophical topic in psychology, which we will not attempt to broach in detail. 
- However, a few concepts are useful.

##  Concepts in measurement

## The many faces of data
- There are a huge amount of ways we can measure things.
    - and our measurement gives rise to data. 
    - (this course would be very short if we did not have data)
- Dependent on our measurement choices, data can look quite different.
    - And have different properties.
- There exist a few different schemes for characterising data.


##  Types of data 
- **Categorical:** Variables with a *discrete* number of response options.
	- These are usually coded as integers.
	- **Binary** variables are a special case with only 2 categories
- Example: Hair colour, Likert Scale items, Degree or Not?

```{r echo = FALSE}
examples <- tibble(
  ID = c(paste("ID", seq(101:105), sep = "")),
  Hair_colour = as_factor(c("Brown", "Brown", "Blonde", "Blonde", "Black")),
  Hair_values = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3),
  Likert_item = as_factor(c("Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Agree", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree")),
  Likert_values = c(5,4,4,2,1),
  Degree = as_factor(c("No", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes")),
  Degree_values = c(0,0,1,1,1),
  ReactionTime = c(1.2, 0.9, 3.2, 55.5, 2.1),
  Height_cm = c(191.2, 180.8, 165.3, 177.1, 201.0),
  Weight_kg = c(88.9, 76.6, 52.0, 81.5, 105.8),
  IQ = c(100, 105, 99, 120, 131)
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(examples[,c(1, 2, 4, 6)]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```


##  Types of data 

 **Continuous:** Variables which can take any real number value within the specified range of measurement.
- Examples: Height in cm; Weight in kg; Reaction time

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(examples[,c(1, 8:10)]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

## Types of data 
- **Categorical**: Variables with a discrete number of response options.
    - Binary data is a special case with only 2 possible values.
- **Continuous**: Variables which can take any real number value within the specified range of measurement.
- **Count**: Variables which can only take non-negative integer values (0,1,2,3 etc.).


##  Levels of measurement 
- Terms coined by Stevens (1946), and we are still using them!
- 4 levels are general discussed (though also critiqued - see additional reading):
	- Nominal
	- Ordinal
	- Interval
	- Ratio
- With each level, the numeric values we apply hold different meanings, and we are able to do more with the values.

## Nominal data
- Binary or categorical variable where numerical markers share no relationship.
- Here is no meaningful ordering.
- Example: Hair colour
    - 1 = Brown, 2 = Blonde, 3 = Black

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(examples[,c(1:3)]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

## Ordinal data
- Binary or categorical variable where there exists a meaningful way to **rank-order** responses.
- Here X < Y or Y > X statements can be made, but we can not meaningfully quantify the differences.
- Example: Likert scale items
    - 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither A/D, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree
    
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(examples[,c(1,4:5)]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

## Interval data
- Variables for which numerical values have meaning.
- There is no true 0 point on an interval scale.
	  - But we can consider differences.
	  - And the differences have a true 0 point.
- Now it gets harder to talk about psychological examples.
    - Some would consider IQ and other test scores as interval.

## Ratio data
- Variables for which numerical values have meaning.
- Variables have a true 0 point.
    - As a result, it is plausible to multiply and divide ratio variables.
    - We can legitimately talk about double X
- We really have few, if any, ratio measures in psychology.

## Data types and R

| R Data Type    | Example           | Level of Measurement | Data Type   |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Numeric        | Reaction Time     | Interval or ratio    | Continuous  | 
| Character      | ID                | Nominal              | Categorical |
| Factor         | Hair Colour       | Nominal              | Categorical |
| Ordered factor | Likert scale      | Ordinal              | Categorical |

## Data types and R

```{r echo=FALSE}
examples[,c(1,2,4,8)]
```

## Measurement matters 
- Data is information.
- The way we describe, visualize and analyse data depends on the type of data we have.

## Let's build a class .rmd
- Over the whole course, we are going to build up a single Rmarkdown file.
- We will use to practice, as a class, things you will do in smaller groups in labs.
- We will live code it (so likely make mistakes)
    - This happens all the time, nothing to worry about.
- We will fix problems
- We will explore the data we create

## Tasks for this week...
1. Finish any existing tasks from lab 1.
2. Reading: Linked at the top of lab 2.
    - Additional reading on final slide. 
3. Quiz 2A (On course guide) and 2B (to show you question types)
    - Both live now.
    - Close Sunday at 17:00
